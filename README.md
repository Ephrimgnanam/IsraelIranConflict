# IsraelIranConflict
In this project, the lists of Threat Actors involved in the actions of the war between Israel (https://github.com/fastfire/IsraelIranConflict/blob/main/Pro_Israel.md) and Iran (https://github.com/fastfire/IsraelIranConflict/blob/main/Pro_Iran.md) are made available. Starting from the list shared by @CyberKnow https://x.com/Cyberknow20, the project makes available the enrichment relating to Telegram channels/groups and websites of the various Threat Actors.

**How to participate in the project?**

2 files have been created within the project, respectively to census the Threat Actors pro Israel and those pro Iran. The list of Threat Actors shared by @Cyberknow is kept updated in the files. For the Threat Actors for which the relevant Telegram contact/channel has not yet been found, in the "Telegram" column there is the indication "enter the Telegram channel link here". You can therefore participate by creating a Pull Request and indicating the Telegram reference (or other information, such as the website or contacts of the Threat Actor present on other messaging systems) for those Threat Actors for which no information is currently present, or by updating the existing information (for example in the case of an invitation that has expired to access a channel).
